    A step belongs to a Job.  Steps execute sequentially, and may be retried.
    A given Job may have multiple 'step 1' records if retries have occurred, in which
    case they may be distinguished by their ``created_at`` attributes.

    The details of the steps for a job are usually only interesting if something has gone wrong
    and the user is interested in any captured exceptions or console output.

    Don't load steps for a job unless they're really needed; the console output may be
    large.
