        PickleFields are a bad idea in this case, the references are to the full Class name such as
        chroma_core.models.host.ConfigureNTPStep so if you move them, or rename them, the
        PickleField fails. To make matters worse debugging the failures is really hard.

        This code below decodes the Picklefield by hand if it fails (we only have 1 case so it's easy) and then
        returns an instance of the class. In a future patch I would suggest the Picklefield is abandoned
        completely.

        The field will be of the form.

        We are interested in the middle line.

        This doesn't solve the whole problem, because anything in args could break it, but as of 3.0 it is OK.

        Truthfully the describe string should be created when the step is created and not created dynamically. Something
        for 3.1 maybe.
