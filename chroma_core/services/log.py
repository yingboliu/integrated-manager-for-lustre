"""
To acquire a log, use `log_register('foo')`.  'foo' is just prepended
to the start of log lines, rather than being used as the filename.  Filename
is determined usually by the service name when running within `chroma_service`.

The intention is that there is a log file per container process, and logs from
a particular module will go to the log of whatever process they are running
within, prefaced with the subsystem name.

Outside of `chroma_service`, use `log_set_filename` to set the filename, or
`log_enable_stdout` to output all logs to standard out.

`settings.LOG_PATH` and `settings.LOG_LEVEL` control the global directory
and level for logging.
